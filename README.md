# qrae
Spanish Royal Academy dictionary desktop client

Install with:

```
kcp -i qrae
```

If you don't have transparent proxy, because of [**DNS redirection**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking), qRAE wont connect almost never. However, don't panic about these bad practices of some network operators: all you have to do is [**switch your DNS**](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using).
